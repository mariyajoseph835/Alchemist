### Project Description
[The Product and Expiry Reminder web application helps users manage their inventory by allowing them to set reminders for product quantities and expiry dates. It notifies users 2 days before products run low or items are about to expire, making it ideal for personal or small¬†business¬†use.]

### The Problem statement
[The app solves the tedious problem of manually tracking product inventory and expiry dates by providing automated reminders. It ensures users are notified in advance to avoid running out of stock or using expired items, saving time and¬†reducing¬†waste.]

### The Solution
[This problem is solved by allowing users to input product details, such as quantity, reminder days, and expiry dates, into the app. The system then automatically sends notifications 2 days before products run low or reach their expiry date, helping users stay organized, avoid expired items, and maintain inventory without manual¬†tracking.]
